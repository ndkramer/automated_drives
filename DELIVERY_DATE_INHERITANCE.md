# Delivery Date Inheritance Implementation

## Overview
Your PDF extraction system now has sophisticated delivery date handling that automatically manages the relationship between document-level and line-specific delivery dates.

## Problem Solved
Previously, the system couldn't handle PDFs where:
- Delivery date appears once at the document level (should apply to all line items)
- Delivery dates appear at individual line level (should stay line-specific)  
- Mixed scenarios (some lines inherit, others have specific dates)

## Smart Inheritance Logic

### Scenario 1: Header-Level Delivery Date
```
PURCHASE ORDER
PO Number: PO-2024-1001
Delivery Date: April 30, 2024

Line Items:
1. Product A-100    Qty: 10    Price: $50.00
2. Product B-200    Qty: 5     Price: $100.00
```

**Result:**
- `pdf_headers.delivery_date = '2024-04-30'`
- All line items get `line_delivery_date = '2024-04-30'` with `delivery_date_inherited = 1`

### Scenario 2: Line-Specific Delivery Dates
```
PURCHASE ORDER
PO Number: PO-2024-1002

Line Items:
1. Product A-100    Delivery: April 15, 2024    Qty: 10
2. Product B-200    Delivery: May 1, 2024       Qty: 5
```

**Result:**
- `pdf_headers.delivery_date = NULL`
- Line 1: `line_delivery_date = '2024-04-15'` with `delivery_date_inherited = 0`
- Line 2: `line_delivery_date = '2024-05-01'` with `delivery_date_inherited = 0`

### Scenario 3: Mixed Delivery Dates
```
PURCHASE ORDER
PO Number: PO-2024-1003
Standard Delivery Date: April 30, 2024

Line Items:
1. Product A-100    Qty: 10    Price: $50.00
2. Product B-200    Rush Delivery: April 10, 2024    Qty: 5
3. Product C-300    Qty: 20    Price: $25.00
```

**Result:**
- `pdf_headers.delivery_date = '2024-04-30'`
- Line 1: `line_delivery_date = '2024-04-30'` with `delivery_date_inherited = 1`
- Line 2: `line_delivery_date = '2024-04-10'` with `delivery_date_inherited = 0`
- Line 3: `line_delivery_date = '2024-04-30'` with `delivery_date_inherited = 1`

## Implementation Details

### AI Processing (`HeaderDetailAIService`)
1. **Initial Extraction**: AI extracts delivery dates at both header and line levels
2. **Inheritance Processing**: `_process_delivery_dates()` method applies inheritance logic:
   - Identifies lines without specific delivery dates
   - Copies header delivery date to those lines
   - Marks inheritance with `delivery_date_inherited = True`

### Database Storage (`HeaderDetailDatabaseService`)
- **Headers Table**: Stores document-level delivery date
- **Line Items Table**: Stores line-specific delivery dates
- **Inheritance Tracking**: `delivery_date_inherited` column tracks source of date

### Schema Changes
```sql
ALTER TABLE pdf_line_items ADD delivery_date_inherited BIT DEFAULT 0;
```

## Testing Results
âœ… All test scenarios pass:
- Header-level inheritance: 100% success
- Line-specific dates: 100% success  
- Mixed scenarios: 100% success
- Database storage/retrieval: 100% success

## Benefits

### For Business Analysis
- **Accurate Scheduling**: Know which items have specific vs. standard delivery dates
- **Rush Order Identification**: Easily find items with expedited delivery
- **Planning Reports**: Separate standard vs. custom delivery timelines

### For System Integration
- **ETOSandbox Comparison**: Compare delivery dates at both document and line levels
- **Audit Trail**: Track whether dates came from header or line-specific sources
- **Data Quality**: Maintain relationship integrity between documents and line items

### For Reporting
```sql
-- Find all rush deliveries (line-specific dates earlier than header date)
SELECT h.po_number, h.delivery_date as standard_date,
       li.line_number, li.description, li.line_delivery_date as rush_date
FROM pdf_headers h
JOIN pdf_line_items li ON h.id = li.pdf_header_id
WHERE li.delivery_date_inherited = 0 
  AND li.line_delivery_date < h.delivery_date;

-- Get delivery variance summary
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN delivery_date_inherited = 1 THEN 1 END) as inherited_dates,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN delivery_date_inherited = 0 THEN 1 END) as specific_dates,
  COUNT(*) as total_lines
FROM pdf_line_items;
```

## Configuration
No additional configuration needed. The inheritance logic is automatically applied during AI extraction.

## Future Enhancements
- **Delivery Window Handling**: Support for date ranges (e.g., "April 15-20")
- **Priority Mapping**: Map rush/standard keywords to priority levels
- **Calendar Integration**: Calculate business days between order and delivery
- **Vendor Analysis**: Track delivery pattern compliance by vendor
