## 💻 How to Use

### 1. Web Upload (Automatic AI Processing)
```bash
# Start the application
python app.py

# Upload PDF via web interface at http://localhost:8080
# AI extraction happens automatically during upload
```

### 2. Query AI-Extracted Data
```bash
# View all AI-extracted data
python query_ai_data.py

# Search for specific fields
python query_ai_data.py po_number
python query_ai_data.py vendor_name

# Get SQL query examples
python query_ai_data.py --sql
```

### 3. Direct AI Testing
```bash
# Test AI extraction on specific PDF
python test_ai_extraction.py
```

## 🔍 SQL Queries for AI Data

### Find All PO Numbers
```sql
SELECT id, filename, 
       JSON_VALUE(ai_extracted_data, '$.po_number') AS po_number 
FROM pdf_uploads 
WHERE JSON_VALUE(ai_extracted_data, '$.po_number') IS NOT NULL;
```

### Find by Vendor
```sql
SELECT id, filename, 
       JSON_VALUE(ai_extracted_data, '$.vendor_name') AS vendor 
FROM pdf_uploads 
WHERE JSON_VALUE(ai_extracted_data, '$.vendor_name') LIKE '%Manufacturing%';
```

### Find by Amount Range
```sql
SELECT id, filename, 
       JSON_VALUE(ai_extracted_data, '$.total_amount') AS total_amount 
FROM pdf_uploads 
WHERE CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(JSON_VALUE(ai_extracted_data, '$.total_amount'), '$', ''), ',', '') AS FLOAT) > 1000;
```

## 🚀 Advantages Over Traditional Extraction

### Traditional Regex/Rule-Based
❌ Requires exact field name matches  
❌ Breaks with format changes  
❌ Cannot handle variations (P.O. vs Purchase Order)  
❌ Struggles with complex layouts  

### AI-Powered Extraction
✅ **Understands Context**: Recognizes fields regardless of exact labeling  
✅ **Handles Variations**: "PO Number", "Purchase Order", "Order #" all detected as same field  
✅ **Layout Flexible**: Works with tables, forms, and unstructured text  
✅ **Self-Improving**: Can adapt to new formats with prompt updates  
✅ **Vendor Agnostic**: No configuration needed for new vendors
