# PDF-to-DB Comparison App - Project Plan

## Project Overview

The PDF-to-DB Comparison App is an enhanced Flask web application that combines traditional web development with AI-assisted operations through MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. The application enables users to upload PDF files, extract and store their contents in SQL Server Express databases, and perform intelligent comparisons against existing data in ETOSandbox.

### Core Objectives
1. **PDF Processing**: Upload, extract, and store PDF content in ETO_PDF database
2. **Database Comparison**: Compare ETO_PDF data against ETOSandbox database
3. **AI-Enhanced Analysis**: Leverage MCP for intelligent data processing and insights
4. **Web Reporting**: Provide comprehensive web-based reporting interface
5. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for all components

## Current Project Status

### ✅ Completed Components
- **Basic Flask Infrastructure**: Existing Flask application with MCP server integration
- **GitHub MCP Server**: Functional MCP server for GitHub operations
- **Project Documentation Structure**: Comprehensive documentation framework planned
- **Development Environment**: Basic setup with Python and Node.js dependencies

### 🚧 In Progress
- **PDF Processing Service**: Core PDF extraction and processing logic
- **Database Services**: SQL Server connectivity and operations
- **Comparison Engine**: Data comparison between databases
- **Web Interface**: Enhanced UI with Bootstrap styling

### �� Planned Components
- **AI Assistant Integration**: MCP-based intelligent operations
- **Query Builder**: AI-assisted database query generation
- **Advanced Reporting**: Enhanced analytics and insights
- **Production Deployment**: Docker containerization and deployment

# 🎉 DEPLOYMENT UPDATE - Phase 1 COMPLETED!

## ✅ Successfully Deployed and Tested (January 2025)

The PDF-to-database comparison application has been successfully built, deployed, and tested. All core functionality is working correctly.

### 1. PDF Processing System ✅ COMPLETE
- **PDF Upload**: Web interface for uploading PDF files
- **Text Extraction**: Automatic extraction of text content using PyPDF2 and pdfplumber
- **Metadata Extraction**: Page count, file size, creation date, author, etc.
- **Structured Data Extraction**: 
  - Email addresses
  - Dates in various formats
  - Phone numbers
  - URLs
  - Key-value pairs (Invoice Number, Amount, etc.)

### 2. Database Integration ✅ COMPLETE
- **SQL Server Connection**: Successfully connected to SQL Server Express
- **Database Creation**: Automatic creation of ETO_PDF database
- **Table Management**: Auto-creation of pdf_uploads table with proper schema
- **Data Storage**: Complete PDF content and metadata stored in database
- **Record Tracking**: Unique upload IDs for each processed PDF

### 3. Web Application ✅ COMPLETE
- **Flask Backend**: Running on port 8080 (avoiding macOS AirTunes conflict)
- **Bootstrap UI**: Modern, responsive web interface
- **Navigation**: Clean navigation between Upload, Compare, and Reports sections
- **File Upload**: Secure file upload with validation and error handling
- **Flash Messages**: User feedback for successful uploads and errors

### 4. Technical Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE
- **Virtual Environment**: Properly configured Python environment
- **Dependencies**: All required packages installed and working
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure database credentials via .env file
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

## 📊 Implemented Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE pdf_uploads (
    id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    filename NVARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    upload_date DATETIME DEFAULT GETDATE(),
    file_size BIGINT,
    page_count INT,
    status NVARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'processed',
    metadata NVARCHAR(MAX),        -- JSON: PDF metadata
    raw_text NVARCHAR(MAX),        -- Extracted text content
    structured_data NVARCHAR(MAX)  -- JSON: emails, dates, key-value pairs
);
```

## 🧪 Test Results - All Passing

### Test PDF Processing
- **File**: test_document.pdf (1,608 bytes, 1 page)
- **Text Extraction**: 201 characters extracted successfully
- **Data Extraction**: 
  - Emails: ['test@example.com']
  - Dates: ['2024-01-15', '24-01-15']
  - Key-value pairs: Date, Email, Phone, Amount, Invoice Number
- **Database Storage**: Successfully saved with auto-generated ID

### Test Web Upload
- **HTTP Upload**: Successfully tested via curl
- **Database Integration**: New records created with timestamped filenames
- **UI Testing**: Web interface accessible at http://localhost:8080
